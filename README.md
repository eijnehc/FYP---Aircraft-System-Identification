# FYP---Aircraft-System-Identification

As part of my final year project at National University of Singapore (NUS), I was tasked to verify an unmanned aerial vehicle’s mathematical model using system identification. I modelled the longitudinal 3 degrees-of-freedom and performed simulations on the aircraft system. The flight data generated were tested using four parameter estimation methods (Ordinary Least Squares, Total Least Squares, Gauss-Newton, Levenburg-Marquardt). Levenburg-Marquardt method produced parameter estimates that best represented the aircraft’s dynamics. The programme was built using MATLAB and Simulink.
